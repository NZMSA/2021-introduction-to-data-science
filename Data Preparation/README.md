## Data Preparation (Titanic Dataset)

_Data scientists spend the majority of their time on data preparation tasks which should give you a clear idea of how important this process is to data analysis, data science, and machine learning._

Data preparation can be boiled down to three major steps: selection, preprocessing, and transformation. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an integral aspect of any data science project. EDA allows data scientists to analyse, investigate, and extract the main characteristics of a data set through data visualisation. Once we have indentified the key characteristics of the data set, we can select those features and ignore any insignificant features.

Data cleansing which is essentially dealing with missing values, outliers, and imbalanced data. This includes dropping instances/attributes of missing values. Imputing the attribute for all missing values. Identifying outliers and whether to remove them. Normalising or standardising data. One-hot encoding.
